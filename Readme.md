This project implements a **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)** framework for intelligent agents in games.  
GOAP allows AI characters to dynamically **plan sequences of actions** to achieve goals, instead of following hardcoded scripts.

## ðŸš€ What is GOAP?

GOAP is an AI technique where agents decide *what to do* by planning a sequence of actions that lead from the **current world state** to a **desired goal state**.  

Instead of scripting behaviors manually, you define:  
- **World States** (facts about the world)  
- **Actions** (things the agent can do, with preconditions & effects)  
- **Goals** (desired states)  

The planner automatically finds the best sequence of actions (a plan) to reach a goal.

## ðŸ§© System Overview

### Core Components
- **`BaseWorldState`**  
  Represents facts about the world.  
  Example: `HasWeapon = true`, `EnemyDead = false`.

- **`BaseAction`**  
  Defines an action the agent can perform.  
  - **Preconditions** â†’ must be true before the action can run.  
  - **Effects** â†’ world changes after action succeeds.  
  - **Cost/Weight** â†’ numeric cost for planning.  

- **`Planner`**  
  The brain of the system:  
  - Builds a graph of actions (`CreateGraph`)  
  - Finds valid plans using **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**  
  - Selects the best action sequence to reach a goal (`ChooseCurrentAction`)  
  - Executes actions step by step (`CalculateAction`)

## ðŸ”„ Planning Flow

1. **Graph Construction**  
   - Each action is a **node**.  
   - If Action Aâ€™s effect matches Action Bâ€™s precondition â†’ add a connection.  

2. **Pathfinding**  
   - Uses **Dijkstra** to precompute shortest paths between all actions.  

3. **Plan Selection**  
   - For each goal, the planner finds the lowest-cost action sequence.  

4. **Execution**  
   - Current action is executed.  
   - If it succeeds â†’ update world state and advance to next action.  
   - If it fails â†’ recompute a new plan.

## âœ… Example

**Goal:** `EnemyDead = true`  

**Actions Defined:**  
- `FindWeapon` (no weapon â†’ has weapon)  
- `PickUpWeapon` (weapon available â†’ has weapon)  
- `AttackEnemy` (has weapon â†’ enemy dead)  

**Generated Plan:**
